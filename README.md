# Applied Statistics I
This repository holds lecture/homework IDE files for each section of my Applied Statistics class, alongside any additional files used for the course. This course uses [R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) for all files, and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) is recommended as a more friendly interface.

This repository is currently a work-in-progress, as I am still currently taking this class.
